Singly Linked List Simulator

A simple and interactive Singly Linked List Simulator built using C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project visually demonstrates how nodes work internally with insert, delete, and traversal operations. Useful for students learning Data Structures.

🚀 Features Visual representation of a singly linked list Insert, delete, search, and traverse operations Node pointer movement animations Clean UI (HTML + CSS) JavaScript-powered interactions C++ backend logic for learning Includes project report + memory diagrams
